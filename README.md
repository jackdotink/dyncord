# Dyncord

Dyncord is a Rust library for building Discord bots with an axum-like API.

Twilight is a Rust library for interacting with the Discord API. It however does not provide a
high-level API and utilities to build bots, so you have to build your own framework on top of
it. Dyncord is a library that provides those high-level APIs and utilities to build bots,
hiding the low-level details of the Discord API to provide a more pleasant DX for Discord bot
developers.

Why "dyncord"? Because I expected it to use a lot of `dyn` internally. Ironically, it ended up
using very little `dyn`.

# Quick Overview

A minimal bot using Dyncord looks like this:

```rust
use dyncord::{Bot, Intents};
use dyncord::commands::Command;
use dyncord::commands::prefixed::context::PrefixedContext;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let bot = Bot::new(())
        .intents(Intents::GUILD_MESSAGES)
        .intents(Intents::MESSAGE_CONTENT)
        .with_prefix(">")
        .command(Command::prefixed("hello", hello));

    bot.run("your-token").await.unwrap();
}

async fn hello(ctx: PrefixedContext) {
    ctx.send("Hello, world!").await.unwrap();
}
```

Then on Discord, just send `>hello` in a channel the bot has access to and it will reply with
`Hello, world!`.

Taking arguments is simple. Just add them to the handler function:

```rust
async fn hello(ctx: PrefixedContext, name: String) {
    ctx.send(format!("Hello, {name}!")).await.unwrap();
}
```

# Installation

Installing is simple. Just add `dyncord` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```sh
cargo add dyncord
```

You'll also need a runtime to run the bot. We only support `tokio` for now, so add it to your
`Cargo.toml` as well:

```sh
cargo add tokio -F full
```

# Quick Start

To start with, create a [`Bot`] instance with [`Bot::new()`](Bot::new). The only argument it
takes is the bot's state, which can be any type you want (`Send + Sync + Clone`). For this
example, we'll just use `()`. We'll also use `.` as the bot's prefix.

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let bot = Bot::new(()).with_prefix(".");
}
```

Great! Now we have a bot instance, let's just add our bot's token and get it to run.

```rust
bot.run("token").await.unwrap();
```

Check Discord and you'll see your bot has come online. Well done! Now, let's add a command to
our bot.

Command handlers are simple to define. The simplest form of a command handler is an async
function that takes a [`PrefixedContext`](commands::prefixed::context::PrefixedContext) as its only
argument. For example:

```rust
async fn ping(ctx: PrefixedContext) {
    ctx.send("pong").await.unwrap();
}
```

To add that command to our bot, we just need to create a command through the
[`Command`](commands::Command) builder and pass it to the bot's [`command`](Bot::command)
method:

```rust
let bot = Bot::new(()).with_prefix(".").command(Command::prefixed("ping", ping));
```

`"ping"` is the command's name, used to invoke the command. So in this case, sending `.ping` in
a channel the bot has access to will trigger the command and make the bot reply with `pong`.

For message commands to run properly, the bot needs to have the `MESSAGE_CONTENT` intent
enabled and any intents required to receive messages. For example, `GUILD_MESSAGES` for
messages sent in servers.

Let's add those to our bot:

```rust
let bot = Bot::new(())
    .intents(Intents::GUILD_MESSAGES)
    .intents(Intents::MESSAGE_CONTENT)
    .with_prefix(".")
    .command(Command::prefixed("ping", ping));
```

Now, when you send `.ping` in a channel the bot has access to, it will reply with `pong`. Good!

Last for this quick start, let's see how to take arguments. Just add them to the handler
function as normal arguments and they'll be parsed and passed to the handler when the command
is invoked.

For example, if we want to take a user as an argument, we can just add a `User` argument to the
handler function:

```rust
async fn hello(ctx: PrefixedContext, name: String) {
    ctx.send(format!("Hello, {name}!")).await.unwrap();
}
```

When invoking the command, just mention a user after the command name and the bot will parse
the mentioned user and pass it to the handler. Adding the handler above to the bot and invoking
it with `.hello @someuser` will make the bot reply with `Hello, @someuser!`.

Handling events is just as simple. Just create a function that takes
[`EventContext`](events::EventContext) as its only argument and pass it to the bot's
[`on_event`](Bot::on_event) method. For example, to handle the `MessageCreate` event:

```rust
async fn on_message(ctx: EventContext<(), MessageCreate>) {
    println!("Received a message: {}", ctx.event.content);
}

let bot = Bot::new(()).on_event(On::message_create(on_message));
```

# Browsing the Docs

Everything doable with dyncord is heavily documented in the docs. The best place to find how to do
something is to look at the item's docs. If it doesn't say anything about it, check the docs of the
module where the item is deifined. Go up a module until you find what you're looking for.

As a quick start, check the documentation of the modules exported at the top level of this crate.
They're the heaviest documented and will give you a good overview of the features provided by
dyncord.

Some important topics that are covered are:

- [State](crate::state) - Application state, how to use it, and how it works.
- [Commands](crate::commands) - How to create commands, the different types of commands, and how to
  use them.
  - [Slash Commands](crate::commands::slash) - All about slash commands.
  - [Prefixed Commands](crate::commands::prefixed) - All about prefixed commands.
  - [Permissions](crate::commands::permissions) - Permission checking and handling.
- [Events](crate::events) - How to handle events, the different types of events, and how to use
  them.
- [Error Handling](crate::error) - How error handling works in dyncord and how to handle errors.
- [Built-in Utilities](crate::builtin) - A collection of built-in utilities that you can use in
  your bot, like a help command. They're also good references to build your own.

# WIP

Dyncord is a work in progress, extremely early in development, and certainly not ready for
production use. Any help is appreciated, whether it's testing, bug reports, or contributions.
