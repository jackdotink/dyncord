//! A handle to interact with the bot's internal state and the Discord API.
//!
//! The [`Handle`] struct provides methods to interact with the Discord API and the bot's internal
//! state (not your custom state type). Currently, it only contains a vector of commands and a
//! method to send messages. It's usually proxied to by contexts, such as in
//! [`CommandContext::send()`](crate::commands::context::CommandContext::send) where it is used to
//! send messages to the channel the command was run in.
//!
//! To send messages, you can use the [`Handle::send()`] method, which returns a [`SendMessage`]
//! builder that is awaited to send the message. For example, in a command function:
//!
//! ```
//! async fn ping(ctx: CommandContext) {
//!     ctx.handle.send(ctx.event.channel_id, "Pong!").await.unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This is also useful, for example, to build a help command by listing the bot's commands via
//! [`Handle::commands`].
