//! Dyncord is a Rust library for building Discord bots with an axum-like API.
//!
//! Twilight is a Rust library for interacting with the Discord API. It however does not provide a
//! high-level API and utilities to build bots, so you have to build your own framework on top of
//! it. Dyncord is a library that provides those high-level APIs and utilities to build bots,
//! hiding the low-level details of the Discord API to provide a more pleasant DX for Discord bot
//! developers.
//! 
//! Why "dyncord"? Because I expected it to use a lot of `dyn` internally. Ironically, it ended up
//! using very little `dyn`.
//!
//! # Quick Overview
//!
//! A minimal bot using Dyncord looks like this:
//!
//! ```
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let bot = Bot::new(())
//!         .with_prefix(">")
//!         .command(Command::new("hello", hello));
//! 
//!     bot.run("your-token").await.unwrap();
//! }
//!
//! async fn hello(ctx: CommandContext) {
//!     ctx.send("Hello, world!").await.unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Then on Discord, just send `>hello` in a channel the bot has access to and it will reply with
//! `Hello, world!`.
//!
//! Taking arguments is simple. Just add them to the handler function:
//!
//! ```
//! async fn hello(ctx: CommandContext, name: String) {
//!     ctx.send(format!("Hello, {name}!")).await.unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! Installing is simple. Just add `dyncord` to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo add dyncord
//! ```
//!
//! You'll also need a runtime to run the bot. We only support `tokio` for now, so add it to your
//! `Cargo.toml` as well:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo add tokio -F full
//! ```
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! To start with, create a [`Bot`](crate::bot::Bot) instance with
//! [`Bot::new()`](crate::bot::Bot::new). The only argument it takes is the bot's state, which can
//! be any type you want (`Send + Sync + Clone`). For this example, we'll just use `()`. We'll also
//! use `.` as the bot's prefix.
//!
//! ```
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let bot = Bot::new(()).with_prefix(".");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Great! Now we have a bot instance, let's just add our bot's token and get it to run.
//!
//! ```
//! bot.run("token").await.unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Check Discord and you'll see your bot has come online. Well done! Now, let's add a command to
//! our bot.
//!
//! Command handlers are simple to define. The simplest form of a command handler is an async
//! function that takes a [`Context`](crate::bot::commands::context::Context) as its only argument.
//! For example:
//!
//! ```
//! async fn ping(ctx: Context) {
//!     ctx.send("pong").await.unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! To add that command to our bot, we just need to create a
//! [`Command`](commands::Command) instance and pass it to the bot's [`command`](Bot::command)
//! method:
//!
//! ```
//! let bot = Bot::new(()).with_prefix(".").command(Command::new("ping", ping));
//! ```
//!
//! `"ping"` is the command's name, used to invoke the command. So in this case, sending `.ping` in
//! a channel the bot has access to will trigger the command and make the bot reply with `pong`.
//! Try it out to see it in action!
//!
//! Last for this quick start, let's see how to take arguments. Just add them to the handler
//! function as normal arguments and they'll be parsed and passed to the handler when the command
//! is invoked.
//!
//! For example, if we want to take a user as an argument, we can just add a `User` argument to the
//! handler function:
//!
//! ```
//! async fn hello(ctx: Context, name: String) {
//!     ctx.send(format!("Hello, {name}!")).await.unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! When invoking the command, just mention a user after the command name and the bot will parse
//! the mentioned user and pass it to the handler. Adding the handler above to the bot and invoking
//! it with `.hello @someuser` will make the bot reply with `Hello, @someuser!`.
//! 
//! # WIP
//! 
//! Dyncord is a work in progress, extremely early in development, and certainly not ready for
//! production use. Any help is appreciated, whether it's testing, bug reports, or contributions.
