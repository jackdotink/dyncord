//! Error types for command running and argument parsing.
//!
//! These errors are generic across all command types, meaning that they're returned by all command
//! handlers via internal wrappers.
//!
//! There's two error types here, [`CommandError`] and [`ArgumentError`].
//!
//! - [`CommandError`] - Either an argument error or a runtime error. Runtime errors are boxed and
//!   type-erased.
//! - [`ArgumentError`] - An error occurred while parsing arguments. It also contains a `Runtime`
//!   variant due to support for custom argument parsers.
//!
//! When [`CommandError`]s happen, they're passed to any error handlers as
//! [`DyncordError::Command`](crate::errors::DyncordError). Match against it and read each error
//! type's documentation to know what happened and where to look at.
